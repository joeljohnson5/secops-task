*API Security Testing Report*

**Project:** Secure API Assessment

1. Introduction

As part of the assignment, I tested the provided FastAPI application hosted on `http://127.0.0.1:9000`.  
Since I am still in the learning phase, I focused mainly on common and easy security checks such as input validation, authentication, error handling, and observing how the API responds to common attacks like SQL injection and rate-limiting attempts.

---

2. Test Environment

FastAPI app running locally via:

  uvicorn main:app --reload --port 9000

Used Swagger UI (`/docs`), terminal (`curl`)- No HTTPS, no authentication, no WAF, no API Gateway

---

3. Security Tests Performed

Below are the tests I conducted along with the results.

---

3.1 SQL Injection Handling

Test:
  
Sent SQL injection payloads such as:

```json
{
"name": "abc' OR 1=1--",
"price": 10
}

Result:

The API accepted the input as normal text and returned it safely.
No crashes, no SQL errors were shown.

Status: Passed
Risk Level: Low

3.2 Input Validation

Test:

Sent incorrect data types:

```json

{
  "name": 123,
  "price": "abc"
}

Result:

The API returned a clean 422 Unprocessable Entity response.
No internal errors, file paths, or sensitive data were exposed.

Status: Passed
Risk Level: Low

3.3 Authentication Check

Test:

Tried to access /items and send POST requests without authentication.

Result:

The API allowed all requests without any login or token.

Finding:

Anyone who knows the API URL can access or modify the data.

Status: Failed
Risk Level: High

3.4 Rate Limiting / DoS Check
Test:

Sent multiple repeated requests in a fast loop.

Result:

API responded normally and did not show any 429 Too Many Requests.
No throttling or blocking was present.

Finding:

API is vulnerable to brute-force or DoS-style flooding.

Status: Failed
Risk Level: High

3.5 Error Handling & Sensitive Data Exposure

Test:

Checked whether errors leak internal details.

Result:

Error messages were clean and only included validation details.
No stack traces, no system paths, and no sensitive internal information.

Status: Passed
Risk Level: Low

3.6 Security Headers Check

Test:

Used:

curl -I http://127.0.0.1:9000/items

Result:

Important headers such as CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, and X-Content-Type-Options were missing.

Status: Failed
Risk Level: Medium

3.7 HTTPS / TLS Check

Test:

Attempted to access the API using HTTPS:

https://127.0.0.1:9000/items

Result:

HTTPS did not work.
All traffic is over HTTP without encryption.

Status: Failed
Risk Level: High

4. CVSS Summary

| Finding                  | CVSS Vector                         | Score | Severity |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ----- | -------- |
| Missing Authentication   | AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L | 7.5   | High     |
| No HTTPS/TLS             | AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N | 7.4   | High     |
| No Rate Limiting         | AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H | 7.5   | High     |
| Missing Security Headers | AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N | 4.3   | Medium   |
| Sensitive Data Exposure  | Not Observed                        |  --   |  --      |

5. Overall Conclusion

This API works correctly, but it lacks several basic security features.
Since it is only a local testing application, these issues are understandable.
However, for real-world deployment, the following improvements are important:

Add authentication (API keys)

Use HTTPS with proper TLS

Implement rate limiting

Add security headers

Restrict CORS

Improve logging and monitoring

This project helped me, as a fresher, understand how to test APIs using different methods and how to identify common security issues.
